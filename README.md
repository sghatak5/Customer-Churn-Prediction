# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using decision tree and random forest algorithms. The dataset used includes various features related to customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns. The objective is to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable insights for reducing customer attrition.


## Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can proactively address issues and improve customer retention strategies.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Data Loading:** The dataset was loaded and examined for structure, missing values, and basic statistics.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and corrected data types.
- **Feature Engineering:** Converted categorical variables into numerical ones using one-hot encoding.

## Model Building
Two models were built for predicting customer churn:
1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

## Model Evaluation
The models were trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using various metrics.

- **Decision Tree Accuracy:** 54.2%
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** 53.02%

Despite tuning hyperparameters and performing cross-validation, the accuracy of both models indicates room for improvement.

## Feature Importance
Feature importance was analyzed to understand the key drivers of customer churn. The most significant features identified by the models provide insights into what factors contribute most to customer attrition.

## Future Scope
To improve the accuracy of the churn prediction models, the following steps can be considered:
- **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional feature engineering techniques to create more informative features.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Experiment with more sophisticated algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform more exhaustive hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Bayesian optimization.
- **Data Augmentation:** Increase the dataset size through data augmentation techniques or by acquiring more data.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models to create a more robust ensemble model.
- **Address Class Imbalance:** Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance if churned customers are significantly fewer than non-churned customers.

By implementing these improvements, the accuracy and robustness of the churn prediction models can be enhanced.

## Conclusion
This project provides a foundation for predicting customer churn using decision trees and random forests. While initial results show moderate accuracy, there is significant potential for improvement. The insights gained from feature importance analysis can help businesses take proactive steps to reduce customer churn.
